  "description": "A mod adding relics and events with varying themes. There's no real end goal behind it, just me implementing neat ideas that come my way via reddit, Discord, other games or even my imagination.\n\nCurrently includes: \nPoison relics, relics that only spawn if the player has a card with poison in it's description.\nExample:\n Contagion: Gain every time you apply 6 poison. If no enemy is poisoned at the end of your turn, inflict 2 poison on yourself. \n\n Starter relic upgrade alternatives.\n Path of Exile based relics like Poet's Pen.\n Reddit Idea thread relics and events. \n\n And more!\n\n For a full list of everything added and an up to date look at what I'm working on, you can take a look at my Github Repository here: https://github.com/erasels/Aspiration-StS/ \n\nLet me know if you have questions, suggestions or found an error.",
