# Aspiration-StS
A hub for my current and future mods. Contains a few poison-based relics, starter relic upgrade alternatives and more.

## Currently contains:
### 1 Event: 
"The Dark Mirror is an event similar to the Golden Idol event built around the Prismatic Shard relic.
You can find all screenshots of it here: https://imgur.com/a/q38ITcO (contains spoilers obviously)

### 9 Relics:
"Vile Toxins" is an uncommon relic for the Silent that applies 2 stacks of Weak and Vulnerable everytime you poison an enemy that wasn't poisoned. A screenshot of (an older version of) it in action can be found here: https://i.imgur.com/CnKjiLs.png

"Infernal Blood" is an upgrade to the "Burning Blood" starter relic of the Ironclad. It replaces the end-of-battle heal with a heal that encourages a more aggressive playstyle. You lose 1 HP for every skill you play and heal 2 for every attack and 1 for every power you play.

"Ring of Ouroboros" is an upgrade to the "Snake Ring" starter relic of the Silent. Instead of drawing cards at a set pace, the ring allows you to draw a card whenever you want, in exchange for taking 3 damage. Just right-click the relic and there you have it!

"Burster Core": Upgrade from "Cracked Core", channel as much lightning as you have empty orbs at the end of your turn, every three turns.

"Snecko Tail": Double the amount of poison applied if the enemy is weakened or vulnerable.

"Contagion": Gain 1 energy for every 6 poison applied if no enemy is poisoned at the end of your turn, apply 2 poison to yourself.

"Hummingbird Heart": Gain 4 Block for every card played on your first turn, reduce the effect by 1 for every turn after until it's 0.

"Headhunter": Gain Charges after killing a monster, gain a set of buffs at the start of battle depending on the amount of stored Charges. Visiting non-monster rooms makes Charges decay based on the type of room.

"Legacy Headhunter": Gain a random buff after winning a battle, each buff you gain this way is applied at the start of each battle for the next 7 battles. CAREFUL: Increases and decreases to the buffs carry over.
