# Aspiration-StS
A hub for my current and future mods. Contains a few poison-based relics, starter relic upgrade alternatives and more.

## Currently contains (as in the current source code, releases may lag behind a bit):
### Events: 
The Dark Mirror is an event similar to the Golden Idol event built around the Prismatic Shard relic.
You can find all screenshots of it here: https://imgur.com/a/q38ITcO (contains spoilers obviously)

The Byrd's Nest is an event that can only be encountered on the first 15 floors, it allows players to get one of the uncommon egg relics early in exchange for a downside. Here are some screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/AX7mh0g

### Relics:
Relics that interact with poison only spawn if you have a card with poison in its description in your deck.

"Vile Toxins" is a common relic that applies 2 stacks of Weak and Vulnerable everytime you poison an enemy that wasn't poisoned. A screenshot of (an older version of) it in action can be found here: https://i.imgur.com/CnKjiLs.png

"Infernal Blood" is an upgrade to the "Burning Blood" starter relic of the Ironclad. It replaces the end-of-battle heal with a heal that encourages a more aggressive playstyle. You lose 1 HP for every skill you play and heal 1 for every attack and 3 for every power you play.

"Ring of Ouroboros" is an upgrade to the "Snake Ring" starter relic of the Silent. Instead of drawing cards at a set pace, the ring allows you to draw a card whenever you want, in exchange for taking 3 damage. Just right-click the relic and there you have it!

"Burster Core": Upgrade from "Cracked Core", channel as much lightning as you have empty orbs at the end of your turn, every three turns.

"Snecko Tail": Double the amount of poison applied if the enemy is weakened or vulnerable.

"Contagion": Gain 1 energy for every 8 poison applied limited to 2 times per turn, if no enemy is poisoned at the end of your turn, apply 2 poison to yourself.

"Hummingbird Heart": Gain 3 Block for every card played on your first turn, reduce the effect by 1 for every turn after until it's 0.

"Headhunter": Gain Charges after killing a monster, gain a set of buffs at the start of battle depending on the amount of stored Charges. Visiting non-monster rooms makes Charges decay based on the type of room.

"Legacy Headhunter": Gain a random buff after winning a battle, each buff you gain this way is applied at the start of each battle for the next 7 battles. CAREFUL: Increases and decreases to the buffs carry over.

"Anachronic Snail Shell": All damage resulting in HP loss from attacks against you is delayed by 1 turn.

"Supercapacitive Coin": Once per combat: On Right-click: Thunder strikes a random enemy for each charge you have. Charges are gained by gaining gold or traveling floors if you have Ectoplasm.

"Poet's Pen": Play the top card of your draw pile when you play an attack. Start combat with 6 stacks of Weak, Frail and Vulnerable on you, reduced by 1 for every 7 floors visited with the associated relic in hand and every boss killed before pickup.

Weaker version of "Poet's Pen": Draw the top card of your draw pile when you play an attack, if it's an attack, play it otherwise discard it.

"Enhanced Actuators": Defect only. Gain 1 Strength for every 2 orb slots.

"Mysterious Auxiliary Core": Defect only. At the end of your turn, Channel 1 Random orb every 3 turns, beginning with the first.

"Fetid Barrel": Whenever you exhaust a card, apply 1 poison to all enemies. Of note, it's a poison relic but can always spawn, even without poison card in deck.

"Baby Byrd": You can probably guess. It's a secret.

"Sticky Explosives": Apply a debuff to the first monster you hit on your first turn. Damaging that monster's HP will deal 40% of the received damage to all monsters. The debuff expires if the monster isn't attacked every turn.

"Frozen jewel": At the end of your turn, gain 2 Block for every enemy that intends to attack. Gain Blur if there are multiple enemies and all intend to attack.

"Lifesprig": Every time you play 6 Attacks, gain 1 Regeneration.

"Ritual Dagger": Take 3 Damage at the start of your turn. When you would die, heal to your Max HP instead and gain Awoken (works once). (Awoken is a buff that heals you for 10% of your damage dealt and weakens monsters at the start of your turn.)

"Kaom's Heart": Raise your Max HP by 100 and become unable get new relics FOR THE ENTIRE RUN.

"Nostalgia": Upon pickup, obtain a random #yStarter #yRelic that you don't have yet.
